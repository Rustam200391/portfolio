<i>Welcome to my portfolio website</

<b>This project about me, about my knowledge and achievements in the field of development.</b>
You can also find out my contact information and see the applied knowledge on specific projects.
And all this is on my decorated github page.

To launch a project, you need to import it in the terminal. To do this, specify the https address that will appear when you click the "code" button above the project files in the github. We specify the address in the terminal after the git clone command.
We write all this while in the folder where we want to import the code.

After importing the files, you need to open the root folder in the terminal and install all the dependencies using the "npm install" command.
